# What The Food?!

Singapore is famous for its food, but how well do you really know our local dishes? 
This is a guessing game where you have to derive the answer through process of elimination!

## How to Play
1. Once the game starts, a random dish is chosen from a pre-set selection of 18 local specialties.
2. Over the course of 3 rounds, you will be given the chance to ask the genie for 3 hints - 1 per round.
3. As you receive hints, you may click the food pictures to eliminate "suspects" - i.e those that do not fit the answers given by the genie!
4. After 3 rounds, "Select" buttons will appear under the food pictures and you will be asked to choose which dish you think was chosen. 
5. Try to go for the longest winning streak and prove to your friends that you're the Makan King/Queen!
